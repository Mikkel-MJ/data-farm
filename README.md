# DataFarm

DataFarm is an innovative framework for efficiently generating and labeling large query workloads. 
It follows a data-driven & white-box approach to learn from pre-existing small workload patterns, input data, and computational resources. 
Thus, DataFarm allows users to produce a large heterogeneous set of realistic jobs with their labels, which can be used by any ML-based data management component.
